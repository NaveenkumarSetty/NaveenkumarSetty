I`ve always taken life as a journey that learns from every situation and rise. So far it has been a road full of interesting events and people. I never stopped with my failures because I believe that you are failing in something you learned from it. As part of my journey, I am fully influenced by logical thinking, and analyzing becomes a hobby that leads to work with programming.

The journey has taken me through a Bachelor's of technology in Kandhula Sreenivasula Reddy Memorial college of engineering (autonomous). where I have learned to program, analyzing problems, and providing solutions. During college time I am an active member of the student organization. It gave me good knowledge about corporation lifestyle, organizing events, and abilities to communicate with people from various fields of expertise.

I am also an enthusiastic learner which takes to Data science which is most relevant to my skills and goals. this has been taken to start learning new things and analyze and providing solutions based on real-time data.

Happy learning :) ðŸ‘‹
